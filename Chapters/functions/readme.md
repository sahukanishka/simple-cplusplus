# Functions 

Functions are constructs that take input, perform some operation, and return an output. For example, a mixer takes multiple ingredients (inputs), mixes them, and then returns a mixture (output). You can use functions as many times as needed, and they will perform the assigned task and return the output, just like a mixer.

### Why We Need Functions

Functions help you write your functionality once and then reuse it whenever and wherever you need. Suppose we are selling apples üçé and want to calculate the profit. Without functions, you would have to write the code to calculate profit every time. However, with a function, you create it once and then use it again and again.

Here's an example in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Function to calculate profit
int calculateProfit(int purchasedValue, int soldValue) {
    int profit = soldValue - purchasedValue;
    return profit; 
}

int main(){
    // Calculate and display profit for a single transaction
    int result = calculateProfit(600, 1000);
    std::cout << "Profit is: " << result << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we created a function called **calculateProfit** that takes two parameters as input and returns the total profit we have made. 

If we want to calculate daily profit, we can easily do it with functions:

```cpp
int main(){
    // Calculate and display profit for multiple days
    int result1 = calculateProfit(600, 1000);
    std::cout << "Day 1 profit is: " << result1 << std::endl;

    int result2 = calculateProfit(400, 700);
    std::cout << "Day 2 profit is: " << result2 << std::endl;

    int result3 = calculateProfit(500, 400);
    std::cout << "Day 3 profit is: " << result3 << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

The primary use of functions is to prevent code duplication. However, it's important to strike a balance; creating functions for very small tasks can slow down the compilation speed.
